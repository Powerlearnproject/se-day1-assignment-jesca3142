Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic approach to writing instructions,building games,apps  and solving real world problems.
In the field of technology software engineering has helped in :
1.enhancing productivity and efficiency
2.ensuaring data is protected 
3.improving the quality of life
4.building realible systems
5.enhanced innovation 



Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The Emergence of Structured Programming (1960s–1970s)
   improved code organization and maintainability making it easy for developers to write in a language that is in a human redable form
2.The Introduction of Software Engineering as a Discipline (1968)
established systematic development methodologies.
3. The Development of Agile Methodologies (1990s–2000s)
    agile methodologies have revolutionized the industry by emphasizing flexibility and collaboration and emphasized customer collaboration.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement Gathering and Analysis:
This is the initial stage,it is where the developer understands customers needs,their expectations and the potential challanges.
Feasibility Study;
this is a phase where you determine is the project archivable.using the given constrains what are the challages that can be faced.
Design:
this is the phase where the system architechture and design are developed.
Coding (Implementation):
the programmers use codes in this phase to transalte the designed document using programme languages and tools.
Testing:
this is where the codes are tested and incase of any problem it is rectified to ensure that the software is working and is free from bags.
Deployment (Installation):
once the testing is done the software is deployed to end users for use. this phase may require installation ,configuration and training.
Maintenance: 
maintainace activities like bag fixing,updates and performance improvement of the system are found in this stage,and it is an ongoing support in order to adress any issue.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodologies is a linear aproach to software development where a phase must be completed before going to the next phase while agile methodologies the projects are broken into sprints that the team works on a set of prioritized assignment.
Examples of scenarios Waterfall methodologies is in manufacterering processes and construction projects where workflow is done sebsequential.
A scenarios  for Agile methodologies in Software Development is :
Marketing Campaigns: good for marketers and advertisers who update their projects when it is trending
Research and Development: because of the uncertainty in research it is good th leave room for new discoveries.
Software Development: Agile is  used in software development projects due nature of technology that is ever evolving.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
a software developer is responsible for designing ,coding and implementing of software projects that meet the requirment of the user,there key responsibilities are,analysis,designing,devolpment,testing and debugging,documenting ,maintainace and updates.
a quality Assuarence Engineer focus on ensuring the quality and the realibility of the project before it is given to the client there key responsibilities are planning,tracking and improvement of the software.
the Project Manager oversees the planning,implimentation and completion of the software project ensuring time and budget is maintained as planned key responsibilities are project planning,risk management,customer feedback and monitoring of the project.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
